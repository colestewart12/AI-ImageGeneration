Class- CS330

Advisor- TA Chris Holland

For this project we looked at three different image generation models two of which are text-to-image models while the third one was an image-to-image model.
Here are the links to the Jupyter Notebooks for the three models:

1. CLIP and BigGan - https://github.com/alpha2phi/jupyter-notebooks/blob/main/nbs/08_clip_biggan.ipynb
2. CLIP and Latent Diffusion Model -
3. Unconditional Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (PyTorch w/ CUDA support) -
